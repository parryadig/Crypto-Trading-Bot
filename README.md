## Crypto Trading Bot

Simple trading bot that uses RSI as trade signal, and binance api.

Steps:

1. Install libraries listed in requirements.txt
2. Replace value of API_KEY and SECRET_KEY
3. Run bot.py

Note that using RSI by itself is not a good trading strategy, and as such this bot should be used as a baseline.
